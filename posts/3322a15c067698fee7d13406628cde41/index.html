 <br> 
 <br>在网上找到了解决方案： 
 <br> 
 <span style="color:#333333;"><span style="font-size:13px;">1、把vs2008镜像文件下的\WCU\WebDesignerCore\WebDesignerCore.EXE 手动解压到一个地方(注意解压出来的文件夹里面有个Office.zh-cn)<br>2、找一个Office 2007光盘或光盘镜像，找到Office.zh-cn文件夹，把该文件夹复制，然后覆盖到上一步解压中的Office.zh-cn中<br>3、在第一步解压出来的文件中有个setup.exe,双击运行，好像是安装vs web 开发什么注意，只要能安装就行<br>4、上一步安装完后再运vs2008的setup.exe</span></span> 
 <br> 
 <br>以上步骤要注意的是， 
 <span style="color:#FF0000;">虽然我的机器安装的是 Office 2010，我开始想用 Office 2010 的 Office.zh-cn 去替换 WebDesignerCore 解压后的 Office.zh-cn，这样做是不行的，直到后面用 Office 2007 的 Office.zh-cn 去替换才成功</span>。

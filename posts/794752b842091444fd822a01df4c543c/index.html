<meta property="og:description" content="因为mysql当前暂不支持full join的关联方式，如果只有两张表关联的情况，可以使用left join、right join、union的方式处理，但是如果存在多张表都需要full join的方式，又如何处理呢？
1、可以采用嵌套子查询的方式，将前面的查询sql语句当成当前full查询的主表，这样相对好理解，可以理解为永远只有两张表的full join。
2、（此方式为本文重点说明的方式）那就是有几个full join，就用几个union，具体如下：
一、先建五张表： CREATE TABLE `lsg_category` ( `id` bigint(10) NOT NULL COMMENT &#39;主键ID&#39;, `type` int(3) DEFAULT NULL COMMENT &#39;物品类型&#39;, `type_name` varchar(255) NOT NULL COMMENT &#39;物品名称&#39;, PRIMARY KEY (`id`) ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COMMENT=&#39;物品类目表&#39;; INSERT INTO `lsg_category`(`id`, `type`, `type_name`) VALUES (1, 1, &#39;水果类目&#39;); INSERT INTO `lsg_category`(`id`, `type`, `type_name`) VALUES (2, 2, &#39;体育类目&#39;); INSERT INTO `lsg_category`(`id`, `type`, `type_name`) VALUES (3, 3, &#39;学习用品&#39;); INSERT INTO `lsg_category`(`id`, `type`, `type_name`) VALUES (4, 4, &#39;办公用品&#39;); INSERT INTO `lsg_category`(`id`, `type`, `type_name`) VALUES (5, 5, &#39;游戏类目&#39;); CREATE TABLE `lsg_fruit` ( `id` bigint(10) NOT NULL COMMENT &#39;主键ID&#39;, `fruit_name` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL COMMENT &#39;水果名称&#39;, `category_id` bigint(10) DEFAULT NULL COMMENT &#39;物品类目ID&#39;, PRIMARY KEY (`id`) ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COMMENT=&#39;水果表&#39;; INSERT INTO `lsg_fruit`(`id`, `fruit_name`, `category_id`) VALUES (1, &#39;苹果&#39;, 1); INSERT INTO `lsg_fruit`(`id`, `fruit_name`, `category_id`) VALUES (2, &#39;桃子&#39;, 1); INSERT INTO `lsg_fruit`(`id`, `fruit_name`, `category_id`) VALUES (3, &#39;西瓜&#39;, 1); INSERT INTO `lsg_fruit`(`id`, `fruit_name`, `category_id`) VALUES (4, &#39;橘子&#39;, 6); INSERT INTO `lsg_fruit`(`id`, `fruit_name`, `category_id`) VALUES (5, &#39;西红柿&#39;, 6); CREATE TABLE `lsg_physical` ( `id` bigint(10) NOT NULL COMMENT &#39;主键ID&#39;, `physical_name` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL COMMENT &#39;体育物品名称&#39;, `category_id` bigint(10) DEFAULT NULL COMMENT &#39;物品类目ID&#39;, PRIMARY KEY (`id`) ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COMMENT=&#39;体育表&#39;; INSERT INTO `lsg_physical`(`id`, `physical_name`, `category_id`) VALUES (1, &#39;篮球&#39;, 2); INSERT INTO `lsg_physical`(`id`, `physical_name`, `category_id`) VALUES (2, &#39;足球&#39;, 2); INSERT INTO `lsg_physical`(`id`, `physical_name`, `category_id`) VALUES (3, &#39;排球&#39;, 2); INSERT INTO `lsg_physical`(`id`, `physical_name`, `category_id`) VALUES (5, &#39;乒乓球&#39;, 7); INSERT INTO `lsg_physical`(`id`, `physical_name`, `category_id`) VALUES (6, &#39;橄榄球&#39;, 8); CREATE TABLE `lsg_game` ( `id` bigint(10) NOT NULL COMMENT &#39;主键ID&#39;, `game_name` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL COMMENT &#39;游戏名称&#39;, `category_id` bigint(20) DEFAULT NULL COMMENT &#39;类目ID&#39;, PRIMARY KEY (`id`) ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COMMENT=&#39;游戏表&#39;; INSERT INTO `lsg_game`(`id`, `game_name`, `category_id`) VALUES (1, &#39;跳绳&#39;, 5); INSERT INTO `lsg_game`(`id`, `game_name`, `category_id`) VALUES (2, &#39;踢毽子&#39;, 5); INSERT INTO `lsg_game`(`id`, `game_name`, `category_id`) VALUES (3, &#39;捉迷藏&#39;, 15); INSERT INTO `lsg_game`(`id`, `game_name`, `category_id`) VALUES (4, &#39;猜猜我是谁&#39;, 16); INSERT INTO `lsg_game`(`id`, `game_name`, `category_id`) VALUES (5, &#39;划拳&#39;, 17); INSERT INTO `lsg_game`(`id`, `game_name`, `category_id`) VALUES (6, &#39;剪刀石布&#39;, 17); CREATE TABLE `lsg_learn` ( `id` bigint(10) NOT NULL COMMENT &#39;主键ID&#39;, `learn_name` varchar(255) DEFAULT NULL COMMENT &#39;学习物品名称&#39;, `category_id` bigint(10) DEFAULT NULL COMMENT &#39;类目ID&#39;, PRIMARY KEY (`id`) ) ENGINE=InnoDB DEFAULT CHARSET=utf8 COMMENT=&#39;学习用品表&#39;; INSERT INTO `lsg_learn`(`id`, `learn_name`, `category_id`) VALUES (1, &#39;书桌&#39;, 3); INSERT INTO `lsg_learn`(`id`, `learn_name`, `category_id`) VALUES (2, &#39;凳子&#39;, 3); INSERT INTO `lsg_learn`(`id`, `learn_name`, `category_id`) VALUES (3, &#39;讲台&#39;, 10); INSERT INTO `lsg_learn`(`id`, `learn_name`, `category_id`) VALUES (4, &#39;黑板&#39;, 11); 二、两张表的full join查询 （a full join b on a." />

<p>五张表的就不列了，以此类推，说明：每次增加一个full join，则新加一个union，而union的内容为他所关联的主表对应的那个union下的内容（直接拷贝下来，然后在末尾加上right join）。</p> 
<p>3、如果既有full join，又有left join或者right join，如何处理呢？这个方式简单，每次遇到left join或者right join，只需要往每个union的最后加上left join或者right join即可。</p> 
<p>我举个例子：（a full join b on a.id=b.id left join c on b.id=c.id）</p>
